    <h1>Number Guessing Game</h1>
    <p>A fun and interactive number guessing game with two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard.</p>
    <h2>Easy Mode:</h2>
    <p>Guess a number between 1 and 100 with 10 attempts.</p>
    <h2>Hard Mode:</h2>
    <p>Guess a number between 1 and 100 with 5 attempts.</p>
    <p>In both modes, the game will guide you whether your guess is too high or too low, and you'll be notified when you win or run out of attempts.</p>
